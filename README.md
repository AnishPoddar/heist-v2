# heist-v2
This is a text-based stealth game running on Borland Turbo C++.

Startup instructions:

Download HEISTX2.CPP and all txt files prefixed 'lvl' (level maps) into the C:\TURBOC3\BIN (or the BIN subfolder of whichever directory Turbo C++ is installed in).
Run HEISTX2.CPP in Turbo C++.

Notes:

The opening screens may look frozen, but are simply waiting for the user to press a key to progress to the next screen.
Similarly, the game map refreshes every time a key is pressed. Enemies will not move until the player moves.

There is a HUD element to the top right of the map specifying which weapon/ability is currently equipped (displays 'Locked' if the desired weapon/ability has not yet purchased at the Store). Press the number keys to hot-swap between them.

The controls and key bindings may be learned from the main menu.
